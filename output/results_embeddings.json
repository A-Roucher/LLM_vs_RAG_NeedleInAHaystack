(The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. \nDOCUMENT:\nOne of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. \nDOCUMENT:\nOne day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. \nDOCUMENT:\nI used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. \nDOCUMENT:\nIt\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. \nDOCUMENT:\nCultivate a habit of impatience about\nthe things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that\nmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't\nneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.\nJust don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much\nof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both\nmake sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. \nDOCUMENT:\nToward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. \nDOCUMENT:\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. \nDOCUMENT:\nYou're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come\nto terms with you.At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the\nattitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for\nthree months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with\nit-- \"something great\" meaning either that someone wants to buy\nthem or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is your\nattitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you,\nbecause both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of\ncommitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what,\nthey'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you\nstick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and\nthey'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  \nDOCUMENT:\nYou'll find more interesting things by\nlooking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.\nThis principle is very powerful.  It's why the best abstract painting\nstill falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies to\nstartups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the\nones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam\nof users.\n5. \nDOCUMENT:\nIn Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. \nDOCUMENT:\nInstead of trying to point yourself in the right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n"}, {"model": "embeddings", "context_length": 37286, "depth_percent": 14, "version": 4, "needle": "\nThe

Reproduced by permission of Steve\nWozniak.)May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIf you\nwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for\nexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would\nbe the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the\nsearch for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because\neconomically that's what startups are.  \nDOCUMENT:\n[5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.\nThis excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,\nwhere people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in\nBoston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway back\nfrom the airport she asked \"Why is everyone smiling?\"I looked and\nthey weren't smiling.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt's\nsupply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for\nit.Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead of\nclubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking\ninstead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd's\nidea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.YouthIt's the young nerds who start startups, so it's those specifically\nthe city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are all\nyoung-feeling towns.  \nDOCUMENT:\nAnd it is a particularly\nvaluable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do\nsomething that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places\nthe atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time\nI fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  \nObviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a\nplace looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  There's still a lot of that there.  If you\nwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for\nexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would\nbe the place to do it.  \nDOCUMENT:\nTheir\ntastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a\nlot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist\ndestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\"\nDOCUMENT:\nIt has to be a place where\ninvestors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors\nare nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their\ntastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a\nlot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist\ndestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   \nDOCUMENT:\nIt's the kind of place where your mind may be excited,\nbut your body knows it's having a bad time.  People don't so much\nenjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.\nAnd if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.\nIt's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life\nisotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York\nis a mystery.  \nDOCUMENT:\nThose\nplaces have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You're better\noff starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or\nbetter still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that\none.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades\nbefore it was associated with technology.  It was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  \nDOCUMENT:\nBut their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\"The\nthesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,\ncities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt doesn't mean, do what\nwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest\nover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired\nof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do\nsomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive\npleasure.  \nDOCUMENT:\nWhen friends came back from faraway places,\nit wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about\ntheir trip.\nI really wanted to know.  And I found that\nthe best way to get information out of them was to ask\nwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from what\nthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.\n\nDOCUMENT:\nAnd it may be more than a question of just solving a\nproblem. There is a kind of pleasure here too. Hackers share the\nsurgeon's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the\nteenager's secret pleasure in popping zits. [2] For boys, at least,\ncertain kinds of horrors are fascinating. Maxim magazine publishes\nan annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and\ngrisly accidents. \nDOCUMENT:\nWhen I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't\u2014for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.

(The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. \nDOCUMENT:\nOne of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. \nDOCUMENT:\n[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.\nDOCUMENT:\nOne day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. \nDOCUMENT:\nI used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. \nDOCUMENT:\nIt\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. \nDOCUMENT:\nCultivate a habit of impatience about\nthe things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that\nmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't\nneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.\nJust don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much\nof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both\nmake sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. \nDOCUMENT:\nToward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. \nDOCUMENT:\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. \nDOCUMENT:\nSo if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. \nDOCUMENT:\nYou're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come\nto terms with you.At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the\nattitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for\nthree months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with\nit-- \"something great\" meaning either that someone wants to buy\nthem or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is your\nattitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you,\nbecause both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of\ncommitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what,\nthey'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you\nstick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and\nthey'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  \nDOCUMENT:\nYou'll find more interesting things by\nlooking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.\nThis principle is very powerful.  It's why the best abstract painting\nstill falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies to\nstartups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the\nones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam\nof users.\n5. \nDOCUMENT:\nI remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England.

People don't so much\nenjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.\nAnd if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.\nIt's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life\nisotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York\nis a mystery.  \nDOCUMENT:\nThose\nplaces have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You're better\noff starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or\nbetter still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that\none.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades\nbefore it was associated with technology.  It was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  \nDOCUMENT:\nBut their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\"The\nthesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,\ncities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  \nDOCUMENT:\nWhen friends came back from faraway places,\nit wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about\ntheir trip.\nI really wanted to know.  And I found that\nthe best way to get information out of them was to ask\nwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from what\nthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.\n\nDOCUMENT:\nI imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber.

I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. \nDOCUMENT:\nThe best one can say is: if you're in a\nstartup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,\nespecially if you deserve them.I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us working\nto make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,\nthe frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high\nthat it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having\nideas.  \nDOCUMENT:\nMost\nnew businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those\ndon't scale.[4]\nAs I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of\nstartup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University\nAve in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  As\nwe walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina\nTobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  \nDOCUMENT:\nOne of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. \nDOCUMENT:\n[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.\nDOCUMENT:\nOne day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. \nDOCUMENT:\nHe responded so eagerly that for about\nhalf a second I found myself considering doing it.In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't\nseem real.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  That\nno doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.\n\nDOCUMENT:\nI used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. \nDOCUMENT:\nIt\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. \nDOCUMENT:\nCultivate a habit of impatience about\nthe things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that\nmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't\nneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.\nJust don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much\nof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both\nmake sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. \nDOCUMENT:\nThe real question is, what's saving startups in places\nlike Silicon Valley?\n[2]EnvironmentI think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place\nwhere startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with\npeople who can help you.

in the startup hub's atmosphere that encourages and supports new ideas and ventures, as mentioned in several documents.", "score": 3, "context": "DOCUMENT\nIf you\nwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for\nexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would\nbe the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the\nsearch for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because\neconomically that's what startups are.  \nDOCUMENT:\n[5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.\nThis excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,\nwhere people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in\nBoston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway back\nfrom the airport she asked \"Why is everyone smiling?\"I looked and\nthey weren't smiling.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt's\nsupply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for\nit.Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead of\nclubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking\ninstead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd's\nidea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.YouthIt's the young nerds who start startups, so it's those specifically\nthe city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are all\nyoung-feeling towns.  \nDOCUMENT:\nAnd it is a particularly\nvaluable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do\nsomething that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places\nthe atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time\nI fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  \nObviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a\nplace looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  There's still a lot of that there.  If you\nwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for\nexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would\nbe the place to do it.  \nDOCUMENT:\nTheir\ntastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a\nlot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist\ndestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\"\nDOCUMENT:\nIt has to be a place where\ninvestors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors\nare nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their\ntastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a\nlot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist\ndestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   \nDOCUMENT:\nIt's the kind of place where your mind may be excited,\nbut your body knows it's having a bad time.  People don't so much\nenjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.\nAnd if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.\nIt's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life\nisotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York\nis a mystery.  \nDOCUMENT:\nThose\nplaces have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You're better\noff starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or\nbetter still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that\none.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades\nbefore it was associated with technology.  It was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  \nDOCUMENT:\nBut their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\"The\nthesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,\ncities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  \nDOCUMENT:\nIt doesn't mean, do what\nwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest\nover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired\nof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do\nsomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive\npleasure.  \nDOCUMENT:\nWhen friends came back from faraway places,\nit wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about\ntheir trip.\nI really wanted to know.  And I found that\nthe best way to get information out of them was to ask\nwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from what\nthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.\n\nDOCUMENT:\nAnd it may be more than a question of just solving a\nproblem. There is a kind of pleasure here too. Hackers share the\nsurgeon's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the\nteenager's secret pleasure in popping zits. [2] For boys, at least,\ncertain kinds of horrors are fascinating. Maxim magazine publishes\nan annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and\ngrisly accidents. \nDOCUMENT:\nWhen I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't\u2014for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  \nDOCUMENT:\nI imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students.
